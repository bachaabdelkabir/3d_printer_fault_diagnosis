About the project (Milestones)

--> Fist part : Arduino project that pulls data from the 3d printer's sensors
      - 1 : Choosing and selecting  the right sensors
      - 2 : Drawing the schematics
      - 3 : Write and test the arduino program
--> Second part : Python program that cleans (preeprocessing) the extracted data from the 3d printer 
      - 1 : Choosing the right tools for data preeprocessing in linux environment
      - 2 : Write and test the program      
--> Third part : Python/R program that uses the extracted data to learn BN structures 
      - 1 : Choosing the best tool for learning BN structures
