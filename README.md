# 3d_printer_fault_diagnosis
A 3D printer fault diagnosis platform that uses AI (Bayseian Networks) and Data acquisition Technics

The aim of this project is to try to identify working faults for FDM machines (Folded Deposit Machines or 3D printers) using an AI framework.

We are going to use a Prusa I3 as an experimental plateforme. I have alredy built it and i will dedicated to this project. Prusa I3 is a very well known 3D printer in market of the maker movement, if aren't already familliar with it please visit the reprap project web site. http://www.reprap.org/
